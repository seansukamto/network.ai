## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Profile not found"
**Solution:** 
1. Backend should auto-create it now
2. Check backend logs for: `Creating missing profile for user...`
3. If still failing, run database migration

### Issue: QR code doesn't display
**Solution:**
1. Check backend is running (port 3001)
2. Test endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/api/sessions/<id>/qr`
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Can't join via token
**Solution:**
1. Verify token in URL is correct
2. Check session hasn't been deleted
3. Test verify endpoint: `/api/sessions/verify/<token>`

### Issue: Mark met page shows no users
**Solution:**
1. Users must join events first
2. Check `/api/users` endpoint returns data
3. Verify at least 2 users exist in database

### Issue: AI not working
**Solution:**
1. Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in backend `.env`
2. Verify backend logs don't show API errors
3. Test: `POST /api/ai/query` with simple query

## üîç Verification Queries

### Check Supabase Data
```sql
-- View all sessions
SELECT * FROM network_sessions;

-- View attendance
SELECT u.name, ns.name as session_name 
FROM attendance a
JOIN users u ON u.id = a.user_id
JOIN network_sessions ns ON ns.id = a.session_id;

-- View connections
SELECT 
  u1.name as user_name,
  u2.name as connected_to,
  c.met_at_session_name
FROM connections c
JOIN users u1 ON u1.id = c.user_id
JOIN users u2 ON u2.id = c.connection_id;
```

### Check Neo4j Graph
```cypher
// View all attendance
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ATTENDED]->(e:Event)
RETURN p.name, e.name;

// View all meetings
MATCH (a:Person)-[r:MET_AT]->(b:Person)
RETURN a.name, r.note, r.at, b.name;

// Count connections per person
MATCH (p:Person)-[:MET_AT]->(other)
RETURN p.name, count(other) as connections
ORDER BY connections DESC;
```
